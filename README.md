# Dota-2-V2
This is a continuation of the project https://github.com/S0ool/Dota-2,
but this time I completed everything on my own.
I’ll probably improve it even more later — just not right now.

What added:
News (without info for each news)
Multi-language
optimazed parser (then it took 50 minutes, now it's also 50 minutes, but at that time it was with one language, and now with 28)
fixed some bugs
(even if I did something else, I don't remember anymore)


I will add:
info for each news
in header will add tab "Game" (all info there), and tab "Esports"


I still use official sources for image and video data (mostly) 
because they take up a lot of space, I'm too lazy to host them myself, 
and I don't really see the point — unless the official servers go offline,
but even then, why would I need it? And you might ask — why bother parsing
at all if it won't work properly without the official servers? 
Well, for me, it was mostly a way to test my skills. Besides, 
I enjoy backend more, and building just the frontend didn’t make much sense 
to me — frontend takes a lot of time, but not necessarily a lot of skill.
